Problem Statement
The Git repository contained several large files that significantly increased its size, making operations slow and potentially reaching limits imposed by remote hosting services like GitHub.

Objective
Remove large and unnecessary files from the repository's history, reduce the repository size, and implement best practices to prevent similar issues in the future.

Tools Used
Git: Version control system to manage source code history.
BFG Repo-Cleaner: A simpler, faster alternative to git filter-branch for cleaning up bad data from Git repository history.
Git LFS (Large File Storage): Used for managing large files without bloating the repository history.
Step-by-Step Solution
1. Identify Large Files
Used the following Git commands to list the largest objects in the repository:
bash
Copy code
git rev-list --all --objects | \
git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | \
sort -nk3 | \
tail -n 10
This helped identify specific large files that needed to be removed or managed differently.
2. Attempt to Remove Large Files Using BFG
Attempted to remove large files directly using BFG Repo-Cleaner:
bash
Copy code
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files "{filename1,filename2}" /path/to/repo.git
Adjusted BFG settings to try and force removal when initial attempts did not remove all files:
bash
Copy code
java -jar bfg.jar --no-blob-protection --delete-files "{filename1,filename2}" /path/to/repo.git
3. Manual File Removal and History Rewriting
When BFG did not update the refs as expected, switched to manual removal using git filter-branch:
bash
Copy code
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_large_file" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
4. Repository Cleanup
Executed Git garbage collection to clean up and compress the repository data:
bash
Copy code
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
5. Verification and Force Push
Verified the repository's size and functionality:
bash
Copy code
du -sh .git/
Force-pushed the cleaned repository to the remote to update all branches and tags:
bash
Copy code
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
6. Implement Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)
Installed and configured Git LFS to handle future large files properly:
bash
Copy code
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.type"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
7. Update .gitignore File
Updated the .gitignore file to ensure temporary or large files are not tracked by Git inadvertently in the future.
8. Documentation and Communication
Documented all steps and shared findings with the team. Advised them to clone the fresh repository to avoid synchronization issues.
Outcome
The repository size was significantly reduced from several hundred megabytes to just 7.4 MB, enhancing performance and manageability. The team is now better equipped to handle large files appropriately with Git LFS.

Conclusion
This comprehensive approach resolved the repository size issue while also setting up preventive measures for future operations, ensuring better management of large files and overall repository health.
